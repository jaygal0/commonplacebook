You cannot (and should not) bully people into buying your product either: ‘It is easier to sell [to] people with a friendly handshake than by hitting them over the head with a hammer. You should try to charm the consumer,’ Ogilvy wrote.10 In some ways, online ads are worse than being hit by a hammer.',

If we didn’t choose convenience every now and then our lives would be hopelessly uncomfortable and inefficient. But convenience is also dangerous. It leads us to have sedentary lifestyles, to eat junk food, to support companies that harm society, to have monotonous and unsatisfactory daily routines, to be uneducated and politically apathetic. Exercising, reading, learning, inventing new ways of living and interacting, and fighting for just causes are as inconvenient as they are meaningful. The most satisfying achievements in life are seldom the easiest. A good life demands a reasonable degree of struggle – the right balance between the ease of convenience and the benefits of meaningful effort. Like pleasure, convenience has to be weighed against the price we have to pay for it, and the consequences that are likely to ensue.1',
