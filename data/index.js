It leads us to have sedentary lifestyles, to eat junk food, to support companies that harm society, to have monotonous and unsatisfactory daily routines, to be uneducated and politically apathetic. Exercising, reading, learning, inventing new ways of living and interacting, and fighting for just causes are as inconvenient as they are meaningful. The most satisfying achievements in life are seldom the easiest. A good life demands a reasonable degree of struggle – the right balance between the ease of convenience and the benefits of meaningful effort. Like pleasure, convenience has to be weighed against the price we have to pay for it, and the consequences that are likely to ensue.1',

A child will have many friends, but only two parents—if that—and parents are more, not less, than friends. Friends have very limited authority to correct.
